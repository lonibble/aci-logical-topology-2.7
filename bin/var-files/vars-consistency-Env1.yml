# conditions for logical testing
# Test static ports attached to an EPG
# For Acitve/Standby cluster it might be necessary that 2 ports are attached to an EPG to ensure failover functionality.
# E.g. firewall cluster nodes are attached to leafs in Pod1 and Pod3, respectively. If there is an EPG where only one port is attached, that might be a problem.
